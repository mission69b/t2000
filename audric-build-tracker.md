# Audric Build Tracker

> Companion to `audric-roadmap.md` — tracks execution status only. The roadmap has all implementation detail.

**Rules:**
- Work phases in order. Do not start Phase N+1 until Phase N is complete.
- Within a phase, work sections in numbered order (they are dependency-ordered).
- Update status after each commit/deploy.
- Status values: `not started` · `in progress` · `done` · `blocked`

## Phase 1 — Daily habit loop (Weeks 1–2)

**Testing rule:** Tests ship with each task, not as a separate phase. CI pipeline from pre-work runs unit + integration + smoke tests on every PR.

### Week 1 — Infrastructure + free features (no allowance needed)

| # | Task | Effort | Status | Blocked by | Repo | Ref |
|---|------|--------|--------|------------|------|-----|
| — | **Deploy `allowance.move` contract** | 1d | done | — | t2000 | ✅ Fresh deploy with scoped allowance on mainnet (`0xd775…968ad`). Config + treasury migrated. SDK allowance methods + `getFinancialSummary()` built (24 tests). Server + indexer redeployed |
| — | **Spec 2 — Session authorization** | 0.5d | done | allowance.move | t2000 | ✅ ScopedIntent type + `buildScopedIntent()`/`verifyScopedIntent()` in SDK. IntentLog table in NeonDB. `executeWithIntent()` wrapper in server. `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY` in AWS Secrets Manager. Cron task def updated with DATABASE_URL + admin key. 10 tests. Gates all autonomous deductions. |
| 1.1 | Notification infrastructure | 3d | done | 0.3, 0.4 | both | ✅ ECS cron (hourly EventBridge → Fargate), Resend emails, SDK `getFinancialSummary()`, real-time HF hook in indexer, audric internal API (notification-users, notification-log, hf-alert), NotificationPrefs + NotificationLog tables, settings UI toggles, `AUDRIC_INTERNAL_KEY` in Vercel |
| 1.2 | Health factor alerts (free) | 2d | done | 1.1 | both | ✅ Shipped with 1.1 — indexer HF hook (critical, 30min dedup, Resend via audric internal API), cron batch (warn, 4h dedup, direct Resend from ECS). Email templates for both levels. Deep link to `/action?type=repay`. Settings UI toggle |
| 1.6 | Unified activity feed + filter navigation | 3d | done | — | audric | ✅ DashboardTabs (Chat/Activity), FilterChips, ActivityCard, ActivityFeed. AppEvent NeonDB table. GET /api/activity: two-layer chain classifier (NAVI/Suilend/Cetus protocol regex + balance heuristics), MPP treasury detection for pay labeling, Sui RPC v2 `transactions` field fix, cursor pagination, dedup. useActivityFeed hook (useInfiniteQuery, date grouping, red dot). Event writers in services/complete for standard MPP + deliver-first |
| — | CostTracker instrumentation | 0.5d | done | — | audric | ✅ SessionUsage table (per-invocation: full token breakdown + cache + costUsd + toolNames + model). Dropped unused LlmUsage. logSessionUsage fires on both chat + resume routes. Demo sessions logged as 'anonymous'. GET /api/stats: public cached endpoint (users, sessions, tokens, cost, cache savings, transactions, top tools) |

**Week 1 total: ~10 days effort.** allowance.move done. Spec 2 (session auth) done. 1.1 done. 1.2 done (shipped with 1.1). 1.6 done ✅. CostTracker done ✅. Week 1 complete.

### Week 2 — Paid features + onboarding (needs allowance deployed)

| # | Task | Effort | Status | Blocked by | Repo | Ref |
|---|------|--------|--------|------------|------|-----|
| — | Allowance onboarding wizard (`/setup`) | 1d | done | allowance.move | audric | ✅ 4-step wizard, two-tx flow (create→deposit), `useAllowanceStatus` hook, /new→/setup redirect, Settings budget card, top-up mode, zero-balance UX. SDK 0.23.0 published |
| 1.3 | Morning briefing (email + in-app card) | 3d | done | 1.1, allowance.move | both | ✅ ECS cron `runBriefings()`: getFinancialSummary → content → allowance deduct ($0.005) → Resend email → store via internal API. 3 variants (savings/idle/debt_warning), context-dependent CTAs, idempotency guard. DailyBriefing table, BriefingCard pinned on chat+activity, useOvernightBriefing hook. 18 unit tests |
| 1.3.1 | Deep link action system | 1d | done | — | audric | ✅ /action page (save/repay/briefing/topup routing), ?prefill in /new auto-sends to engine, ?section in /settings. notification-users now returns allowanceId from UserPreferences |
| 1.4 | Savings goals (chat + management UI) | 3d | done | 0.3 | audric | ✅ SavingsGoal Prisma model + CRUD API, 4 engine tools (create/list/update/delete), Goals section in settings (GoalCard + GoalEditor), useGoals hook, progress bars in BriefingCard, cron milestone detection (25/50/75/100%) with celebration emails + AppEvents |
| 1.4.1 | Feedback loop data layer | 2d | done | 1.4 | both | ✅ `AdviceLog` + `SavingsGoalDeposit` tables, `AppEvent` +4 fields (adviceLogId, goalId, suiTxVerified, source). `record_advice` engine tool (auto permission), `handleAdviceResults()` in chat route, `buildAdviceContext()` memory injection (last 5 advice, 30d). Outcome checker + follow-up queue deferred to Phase 3.3 |
| 1.5 | New user onboarding + ToS | 1.5d | done | 0.6 | both | ✅ **ToS:** 2 new sections (Fees + Allowance), `tosAcceptedAt` on User, consent checkbox in `/setup`, catch-up banner for existing users. **Onboarding:** WelcomeCard (Passport + Save/Swap/Send/Ask), `onboardedAt` first-run detection, `useUserStatus` hook, 24h follow-up cron job (3 email variants). Migration backfills existing users |
| — | AI session charge ($0.01/session) | 0.5d | done | allowance.move | both | ✅ `POST /api/internal/charge` on t2000 server (Hono, x-internal-key auth). Audric chat route calls on new sessions via `chargeSession()`. Fire-and-forget, graceful degradation. Uses `ALLOWANCE_FEATURES.SESSION` (4) |
| — | Grace period for empty allowance | 1d | not started | session charge | both | When balance=0: allow 5 free sessions then hard wall + top-up CTA. Needs: distinct `insufficient_allowance` error from charge endpoint, synchronous charge, grace counter in `UserPreferences.limits`, reset on success, banner + wall UI. Briefings just stop. **Trigger: first real "insufficient balance" in prod logs** |

**Week 2 total: ~12 days effort.** All tasks complete. Onboarding wizard ✅, 1.3 + 1.3.1 ✅, 1.4 + 1.4.1 ✅, 1.5 ✅, session charge ✅. Grace period deferred (triggered by first prod insufficient balance).

**Critical path:** allowance.move ✅, Spec 2 (session auth) ✅, digest replay protection ✅, 1.1 ✅ + 1.2 ✅ (Week 1 infra complete), onboarding wizard ✅ (paid features unblocked), 1.6 activity feed ✅, CostTracker ✅, 1.3 morning briefing ✅ + 1.3.1 deep links ✅, 1.5 onboarding + ToS ✅, 1.4 savings goals ✅, 1.4.1 feedback loop ✅, session charge ✅. **Phase 1 complete.** Next: Phase 2 (Receive + payments) + landing pages (parallel).

---

## Phase 2 — Receive + payments (Weeks 3–5) — ✅ COMPLETE

| # | Task | Effort | Status | Blocked by | Repo | Ref |
|---|------|--------|--------|------------|------|-----|
| 2.1 | Payment links + QR codes (all 5 page states) | 4d | done | 1.1 | audric | ✅ PaymentLink Prisma model, CRUD API (`/api/payment-links`, `/api/payment-links/[slug]`), `/pay/[slug]` page (5 states: active/paid/expired/cancelled/not_found), QR code (client-side), `generateSlug` utility. Auth guards + state validation on PATCH. |
| 2.2 | Invoices | 3d | done | 2.1 | audric | ✅ Invoice Prisma model, CRUD API (`/api/invoices`, `/api/invoices/[slug]`), `/invoice/[slug]` page (6 states), line items, overdue detection. |
| ~~2.3~~ | ~~AlchemyPay fiat on/off-ramp~~ | — | skipped | — | — | Deferred post-Store. Not on the critical path. Can add later as a config change |
| 2.4 | Send UX improvements (memo) | 1d | done | — | both | ✅ `memo` param added to `send_transfer` engine tool + SDK `send()`. Shown in TransactionReceiptCard. PermissionCard displays memo in confirmation. |
| ~~2.5~~ | ~~Mini-storefront (sync products)~~ | — | skipped | — | — | Skipped — building the real storefront in Phase 5 avoids rebuilding twice |

| RC-0 | Shared card primitives (`CardShell`, `MiniBar`, `Gauge`, `TrendIndicator`, `MonoLabel`) | 0.5d | done | — | audric | ✅ `components/engine/cards/primitives.tsx`. Gauge has `colorMode` prop (`health_factor` / `usage`). Also: `SuiscanLink`, format utils (`fmtUsd`, `fmtPct`, `fmtAmt`, `fmtRelativeTime`). |
| RC-1 | `HealthCard` — gauge bar, status badge, supplied/borrowed/maxBorrow | 0.5d | done | RC-0 | audric | ✅ HF gauge colour-coded, breakpoints aligned with engine (`<1.2` critical, `<1.5` danger, `<2.0` warning). |
| RC-2 | `TransactionHistoryCard` — date-grouped list, action icons, Suiscan links | 0.5d | done | RC-0 | audric | ✅ Date-grouped, action icons, Suiscan deep links. |
| RC-3 | `SwapQuoteCard` — rate, impact warning, route | 0.25d | done | RC-0 | audric | ✅ Rate display, impact amber >1% / red >3%, divide-by-zero guard. |
| RC-9 | Enhanced `TransactionReceiptCard` — per-tool hero lines, service-specific rendering | 0.5d | done | RC-0 | audric | ✅ `getHeroLines()` dispatches per write tool. Displays memo if present. |
| RC-reg | Register all new cards in `CARD_RENDERERS` | 0.25d | done | RC-1, RC-2, RC-3 | audric | ✅ `ToolResultCard.tsx` refactored to thin registry. All cards wired. |
| AC-1 | `allowance_status` engine tool + `AllowanceCard` | 0.5d | done | RC-0 | both | ✅ Read tool (auto). `try/catch` around fetch. `AllowanceCard` uses `colorMode="usage"` on Gauge. |
| PL-1 | `create_payment_link`, `list_payment_links` engine tools + `PaymentLinkCard` | 0.5d | done | 2.1 | both | ✅ Engine tools call internal Audric API. `PaymentLinkCard` renders created/list views with slug display + copy feedback. |
| PL-2 | `cancel_payment_link` engine tool + PATCH `/api/internal/payment-links` | 0.25d | done | PL-1 | both | ✅ Confirmation-first cancellation flow enforced in system prompt. |
| PL-3 | On-chain payment detection for payment links | 0.5d | done | 2.1 | audric | ✅ `POST /api/payment-links/[slug]/verify` queries Sui RPC for USDC transfers. Client-side polling every 8s with "Checking for payment..." indicator. |
| INV-1 | `create_invoice`, `list_invoices` engine tools + `InvoiceCard` | 0.5d | done | 2.2 | both | ✅ Engine tools call internal Audric API. `InvoiceCard` renders created/list views with slug + memo display. |
| INV-2 | `cancel_invoice` engine tool + PATCH `/api/internal/invoices` | 0.25d | done | INV-1 | both | ✅ Confirmation-first, ambiguity-safe cancellation enforced in system prompt. |
| INV-3 | On-chain payment detection for invoices | 0.5d | done | 2.2 | audric | ✅ `POST /api/invoices/[slug]/verify` queries Sui RPC for USDC transfers. Client-side polling every 8s with "Checking for payment..." indicator. |

**Critical path:** 2.1 → 2.2. 2.4 is independent. RC-0 unblocks all cards. Engine read tools: 26 total. **Phase 2 complete ✅**

---

## Phase 2.5 — Engine foundation (parallel with Phase 2)

> Refactoring work that prepares the engine for the Reasoning Engine + Intelligence Layer. Zero feature risk — these are internal structural changes. Can be done in parallel with Phase 2. **Must complete before Phase 3.5.**

| # | Task | Effort | Status | Blocked by | Repo | Ref |
|---|------|--------|--------|------------|------|-----|
| 2.5.1 | Extract `engine-context.ts` — create file, move `buildAdviceContext` from `engine-factory.ts`, export it | 0.5d | done | — | audric | ✅ `lib/engine/engine-context.ts` created. `buildAdviceContext` moved + exported. Shared types (`WalletBalanceSummary`, `Contact`, `GoalSummary`) extracted. Stubs for all Phase 3.5 functions (F1–F5 + `buildFullDynamicContext`) scaffolded with TODOs. |
| 2.5.2 | Restructure `buildSystemPrompt` — split static (cacheable) vs dynamic (per-session) blocks | 1d | done | 2.5.1 | audric | ✅ `STATIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (constant, no interpolation, cache-ready for RE-1.3) + `buildDynamicBlock()` (wallet, balances, write tools, contacts, goals, advice) both in `engine-context.ts`. `buildSystemPrompt()` in `engine-factory.ts` is now a 3-line wrapper. Zero behaviour change. |
| 2.5.3 | `maxTokens: 2048 → 8192` (configurable) | 0.5h | done | — | audric | ✅ `engine-factory.ts` authenticated engine: 2048 → 8192. Unauth engine stays at 1536. |
| 2.5.4 | `toolChoice: 'any' → 'auto'` with thinking guard | 0.5h | done | — | audric | ✅ `engine-factory.ts` authenticated engine: `'any'` → `'auto'`. Full thinking guard wires in with RE-1.1. |
| 2.5.5 | Settings > Memory page scaffold + nav entry | 0.5d | done | — | audric | ✅ `memory` section added to `app/settings/page.tsx` sidebar nav. Shows: user-provided financial profile (if set via 2.5.6), agent-inferred profile placeholder (F1 stub — "Building profile…"), episodic memories empty state (F3 stub), disabled "Clear All Memory" button. Fetches `UserPreferences.limits.financialProfile` on section mount. |
| 2.5.6 | Optional onboarding profile prompt | 0.5d | done | 2.5.5 | audric | ✅ Step 4 inserted into `/setup` wizard (first-time setup only; topup flow unchanged). 3 radio options (conservative / balanced / growth) + optional notes textarea. Skip button prominent. Saves to `UserPreferences.limits.financialProfile` via new `POST /api/user/financial-profile` (merge-safe, preserves existing limits). Success moves to step 5. `ProgressBar` updated to 5-step total for non-topup flows. |

| RC-4 | `ServiceCatalogCard` — grouped by category, prices per request | 0.5d | done | RC-0 | audric | ✅ `ServiceCatalogCard.tsx` — categories collapsible, endpoint rows show service·name·price. Wired in `ToolResultCard.tsx` for `mpp_services`. **Production-tested ✅** |
| RC-5 | `SearchResultsCard` — title, URL, snippet, expandable | 0.25d | done | RC-0 | audric | ✅ `SearchResultsCard.tsx` — max 3 shown, "Show N more" expander, clickable titles, domain display. Wired for `web_search`. **Production-tested ✅** |
| AC-2 | `toggle_allowance` engine tool — pause/resume agent | 0.5d | done | AC-1 | both | ✅ Read tool (isReadOnly: true). PATCH `/api/allowance/[address]` with `{ action: 'toggle', enabled }`. Returns updated AllowanceCard. System prompt confirms before call. **Production-tested ✅** |
| AC-3 | `update_daily_limit` engine tool — change spending cap via chat | 0.25d | done | AC-1 | both | ✅ Read tool. PATCH with `{ action: 'setLimit', dailyLimitUsdc }`. Validates 0–10000 range. **Production-tested ✅** |
| AC-4 | `update_permissions` engine tool — enable/disable feature categories via chat | 0.25d | done | AC-1 | both | ✅ Read tool. PATCH with `{ action: 'setPermissions', permissions }`. Valid: savings, send, pay, credit, swap, stake. **Production-tested ✅** Post-release fixes: default permissions expanded to all 6, gauge 80% label removed, reset time formatted, duplicate card dedup in `ChatMessage.tsx`. |
| CA-0 | Canvas infrastructure — `canvas` EngineEvent type, `CanvasCard.tsx`, `CanvasModal.tsx`, wire into `ToolResultCard` registry | 1.5d | not started | RC-0 | audric | No external deps. Spec: Canvas plan §CA-0 |
| CA-1 | `render_canvas` engine tool — template enum, params schema, data fetcher, canvas event emission | 1d | not started | CA-0 | both | Register alongside read tools. Spec: Canvas plan §CA-1 |

**Estimated effort:** ~3 days (engine) + ~1.75 days (rich UX) + ~2.5 days (canvas infra). No external dependencies. Can be done during Phase 2 downtime.

**Completed so far:** 2.5.1 ✅ · 2.5.2 ✅ · 2.5.3 ✅ · 2.5.4 ✅ · 2.5.5 ✅ · 2.5.6 ✅ · RC-4 ✅ · RC-5 ✅ · AC-2 ✅ · AC-3 ✅ · AC-4 ✅ (all production-tested). Engine at `@t2000/engine@0.28.7`.
**Remaining:** CA-0 · CA-1

## Phase AC — Audric Canvas (parallel with Phase 3)

> Interactive on-chain financial intelligence. Users generate visualizations and strategy simulators through natural language — the crypto-native equivalent of Perplexity Computer. No account linking required; the wallet IS the data. Visualize → act in the same conversation.
>
> **Canvas plan spec:** `.cursor/plans/audric_canvas_feature_cfe76b5b.plan.md`
>
> **Parallel track:** CA-0 + CA-1 ship in Phase 2.5 (no deps). CA-2/CA-4/CA-6 start immediately after. CA-3/CA-5 gate on FA-4/FA-2. CA-7 (the "Perplexity moment") is the capstone once all data templates are ready.

| # | Task | Effort | Status | Blocked by | Repo | Ref |
|---|------|--------|--------|------------|------|-----|
| CA-2 | Activity Heatmap — `GET /api/analytics/activity-heatmap` + `ActivityHeatmapCanvas.tsx` (GitHub-style grid, hover tooltip, click-to-chat) | 2d | not started | CA-0, CA-1 | audric | AppEvent table exists. Canvas plan §CA-2 |
| CA-4 | Strategy simulators — `YieldProjectorCanvas`, `HealthSimulatorCanvas`, `DCAPlanner` — interactive sliders, no API needed | 1.5d | not started | CA-0 | audric | Client-side only (uses existing `/api/positions`). Canvas plan §CA-4 |

| CA-8 | Contextual canvas suggestions — update dynamic prompt block to suggest canvas after tool results, add Charts chip to chip bar | 0.5d | not started | 2.5.2, CA-1 | audric | Prompt layer only. Canvas plan §CA-8 |

**Critical path:** CA-0 (Phase 2.5) → CA-1 (Phase 2.5) → CA-2 + CA-4 + CA-6 (parallel, start Phase AC) → CA-7 (capstone). CA-3 + CA-5 gate on FA-4 + FA-2 from Phase 3. CA-8 gates on 2.5.2.
**Estimated effort:** ~9.5 days. First interactive canvas (CA-2 heatmap) ships before Phase 3.5. CA-7 ships as Phase 3 analytics complete.

---

## Phase 3.5 — Intelligence Layer (after 3.3.1, ~3 weeks)

> Reasoning Engine + Intelligence features ship here. Depends on Phase 2.5 (engine foundation) being complete and Phase 3 features (DCA, auto-compound, feedback processing) being stable. The full tool set must be built before wrapping intelligence around it.

## Phase 5 — Creator marketplace (Weeks 11–13)

| # | Task | Effort | Status | Blocked by | Repo | Ref |
|---|------|--------|--------|------------|------|-----|

Types: savings (live), wealth (total portfolio), investment (specific assets), earning (Store revenue), compound (cumulative yield). Weekly/monthly check-ins instead of daily. Refactor when Store or DCA ships. Spec: `audric-roadmap.md` §1.4 |

**Critical path:** 5.1 unblocks nearly everything. 5.4 (Walrus + Seal) is independent. 5.9 triggers on first of DCA (3.3) or Store (5.1).

*Last updated: April 10 2026. Phase 1 ✅ complete. Phase 2 ✅ complete (payment links, invoices, memo send, P0 rich cards RC-0–RC-3/RC-9/RC-reg, AC-1 allowance tool, SDK/CLI/MCP receive feature). Landing pages ✅ complete. Next: Phase 2.5 (engine foundation + P1 cards + AC-2/3/4 allowance tools + CA-0/CA-1 canvas infra — all parallel, no blocking deps). Phase 3 includes proactive agent + financial analytics (FA-2, FA-4, FA-5). Phase AC (Audric Canvas — ~9.5 days) runs parallel to Phase 3. Phase 3.5 (Intelligence Layer) is the capstone before Phase 5 Store.*
