# t2000 Repo Layout

> **Single source of truth for "where does X go?" in this monorepo.**

This is the public-facing layout reference.

## Top-level structure

> Internal product specs, design decisions, and runbooks live in a local-only `spec/` tree that is not part of the public repo. Ask the maintainers if you need access. The brand redesign designer handoff source lives in a gitignored `t2000-AFI/` folder (static React+Babel prototype; shipped artifacts live in `packages/ui/`).

## Where does X go?

| If X is a... | Put it in... |
|---|---|
| Public developer docs page (setup, API ref, examples) | `apps/docs/<slug>.mdx` (Mintlify; deploys to `developers.t2000.ai`) |
| Package README | `packages/<pkg>/README.md` |
| App README | `apps/<app>/README.md` |

All public developer docs live in `apps/docs/` (Mintlify). There is no public `docs/` folder.

If a file would go at the repo root and it's not on the allowlist below, push it into one of the above subdirectories instead.

## Root-level allowlist

These are the ONLY files that should live at repo root (everything else moves to a subdir):

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Public landing page |
| `LICENSE` | MIT |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Agent context (loaded every session by Claude Code) |
| `ARCHITECTURE.md` | System architecture reference |
| `REPO_LAYOUT.md` | Contributor "where does X go?" SSOT (this file) |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security disclosure policy |
| `.gitignore`, `.npmrc`, `.prettierrc` | Tooling config |
| `package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | Workspace |
| `tsconfig.base.json`, `turbo.json`, `glama.json` | Build config |
| `install.sh` | One-shot installer |

Plus founder-local truth source (gitignored, not visible publicly):
- `audric-build-tracker.md` (build progress log, ~3 MB rotation policy)
- `PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md` (whole-product master roadmap)
- `HANDOFF_NEXT_AGENT.md` (agent context handoff, ~7d rotation policy)
- `.smoke-*` (live smoke tooling)
- `.env.local`, `.env.example`
- `t2000-AFI/` (designer handoff source for the brand-unification redesign; static React+Babel prototype with Geist Design System tokens + per-property accent overrides; canonical reference during the redesign work — shipped artifacts live in `packages/ui/`)

## audric repo (sister repo, separate clone)

See `audric/CLAUDE.md` for analogous layout. Key conventions:

- `audric/apps/web-v2/docs/` — runbooks, post-mortems, security advisories, regression matrices
- `audric/.cursor/rules/` — workspace rules (loaded every session)
- `audric/.claude/rules/` — Claude Code rules
- `audric/scripts/` — operational scripts (smoke, env-parity, dump-session)

## Linked references

- `CLAUDE.md` "Key Documents" section — pointer table from agent context
- `audric/CLAUDE.md` — sister repo analogue
