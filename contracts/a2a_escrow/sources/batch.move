/// Design notes (annex + Build risk control, locked):
/// - **VERSION cutover (S.1192-style, D23).** New entries + new DF keys,
///   no live signature changes — but the S.1202 upgrade ships with
///   `escrow::VERSION` 6→7 + an immediate `migrate`, because leaving old
///   bytecode callable would let v11 `create_batch_open` / `batch_claim` /
///   bare `release_v2` bypass active-claim semantics and origin settle.
///   Every entry gates on the live VERSION via
///   `escrow::assert_version_pkg` like every sibling.
/// - **Escrow invariant** — `escrow.value() == amount * slots_remaining`,
///   asserted after every mutation (claim / cancel / refund). The last
///   claim drains the balance to zero.
/// - **Filled batches are NOT deleted in v1.** `claims_by_agent` is a
///   `Table` that cannot be dropped while non-empty; a drained batch stays
///   shared with `slots_remaining == 0` and an empty balance (the
///   invariant holds at 0 × amount). The indexer derives `filled`.
/// - **Phase C gates reused verbatim at claim**: claimer's OWN
///   `&mut AgentScore` (ownership asserted), claim policy 0/1/2,
///   `min_seller_level` on the EFFECTIVE level, and the per-level active
///   cap — a batch slot occupies a seat exactly like a single claim.
/// - **Per-wave claims are ACTIVE holds, Level-scaled (S.1202, D11–D16).**
///   `claims_by_agent[agent]` counts this agent's IN-FLIGHT slots of THIS
///   wave — release / reject / refund free one (saturating −1, row removed
///   at 0); a finisher may claim the same wave again while slots remain.
///   The claim gate is `min(max_claims_per_agent, active_cap_for_level)`:
///   the buyer's `max_claims_per_agent` is a diversity CEILING (post 1 for
///   spread), and seller Level scales how much of a high ceiling one agent
///   may hold concurrently. Decline does NOT free the wave seat (parity
///   with the global active counter — claim→decline churn can't farm
///   slots).
/// - **Legacy batches reject new claims (D21).** Pre-S.1202 waves carry
///   lifetime rows that would lock finishers out forever; `batch_claim`
///   aborts `ELegacyBatch` when `ActiveClaimsSemanticsKey` is missing.
///   Cancel / expired-refund on legacy batches stay allowed, and their
///   in-flight Jobs (no `BatchOriginKey`) keep settling via the v2 doors.
/// - **One claim per tx (v1 lock, founder 2026-08-25)** — no multi-claim
///   PTBs; a claimer below their wave cap claims again in a new tx.
/// - **Per-slot amount bounds only.** `amount` obeys the live min/max job
///   bounds; the TOTAL (`amount × slots`) is deliberately unbounded here —
///   the wallet balance and the desk's own budget bound it.
