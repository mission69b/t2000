///
/// One shared `Job<T>` per engagement. The funds live IN the object
/// (`Balance<T>`) — no treasury, no pool. Every transition is a pure function
/// of (state, clock, caller):
///
///   FUNDED ──deliver (seller, before deadline)──▶ DELIVERED
///   FUNDED ──release (buyer: goodwill/late-accept)──▶ RELEASED
///   FUNDED ──refund (ANYONE, after deadline)──▶ REFUNDED      → buyer
///   DELIVERED ──release (buyer accept)──▶ RELEASED            → seller
///   DELIVERED ──release (ANYONE, review window lapsed)──▶ RELEASED
///   DELIVERED ──reject (buyer, within review window)──▶ REJECTED
///                → split per `reject_split_bps` agreed at create
///
/// The two timeout paths are permissionless cranks: a ghosting buyer can't
/// strand a delivering seller (timeout-release), and a broken seller can never
/// keep committed funds (deadline-refund). t2000 operates NO part of this —
/// the gateway only reads the object + events for display.
///
/// Design notes (contract review + D-1, 2026-07-18):
/// - **Protocol fee (D-1):** `fee_bps` (2.5% at launch) snapshotted onto the
///   Job at create from the shared `FeeConfig` — terms can never move under a
///   funded job. Charged ONLY on seller-bound funds at settlement (release
///   payout AND the seller's share of a reject split — so a 0-split reject
///   can't dodge it). Refunds to the buyer are always fee-free. The receiver
///   is read from `FeeConfig` at settle time; only the `AdminCap` holder can
///   rotate it or change the bps (hard-capped at `MAX_FEE_BPS`).
/// - **Versioning:** shared `FeeConfig` carries a `version` + every entry
///   gates on it — the standard Sui upgrade pattern, so a future in-place
///   upgrade can invalidate stale package flows via `migrate`.
/// - **Bounded windows:** `review_window_ms` and the deliver horizon are
///   capped at create. Unbounded values would let a hostile buyer set
///   `review_window_ms` near u64::MAX and make `delivered_at_ms +
///   review_window_ms` overflow-abort — permanently locking a DELIVERED
///   job's funds (release and reject both hit that addition).
/// - **u128 bps math:** split/fee arithmetic widens to u128 before the
///   multiply, removing the theoretical `amount * bps` u64 overflow.
///
/// The x402 tie-in: a job-class 402 advertises `intent: "escrow"`; the
/// X-PAYMENT credential carries the Job object id, which the seller verifies
/// on-chain (funded, my address, right amount) before starting work —
/// chain-verified, so it works for every signer including zkLogin.
///
/// Generic over the coin type `T` (USDC in practice — the client caps job
/// value; the contract stays value-neutral).
