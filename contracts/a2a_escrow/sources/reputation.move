///
/// Parallelism, honestly (S.1054b): review EDITS and later reviews touch
/// only that seller's score (parallel across sellers), and Proven claims
/// take the claimer's score by IMMUTABLE reference (parallel with
/// everything). The exception is the FIRST review a seller ever gets:
/// `submit_first_review` needs `&mut ScoreBoard` for
/// `derived_object::claim`, so all new-score creates serialize on the one
/// board — an accepted v1 scale limit (first reviews are rare relative to
/// reviews). Two racers creating the same seller's score: one wins, the
/// loser aborts on the derived claim and retries with `submit_review`
/// against the score that now exists.
///
/// **Placement (documented deviation from SPEC_AGENT_ID_REPUTATION §3's
/// "prefer agent_id"):** the review writer must see `&Job<T>` to verify the
/// receipt, and `a2a_escrow` already depends on `agent_id` — storing the
/// score under `agent_id` would need either an illegal dependency cycle or a
/// hardcoded witness-package handshake (three ordered mainnet upgrades, since
/// the witness type's defining id doesn't exist until escrow republishes).

/// (module-internal, `apply_review` is private) and the cutover to ONE
